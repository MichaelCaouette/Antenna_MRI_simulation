# Antenna_MRI_simulation
Welcome to the RF simulator. 
It permits to simulate a time-varying magnetic field. 

TOBE UPDATED WITH THE PROPER FILE AND METHOD
The worklflow is has follow:

 --- Simple simulation of the Field --- 
- Define the geometry of the wires
	WHICH CODE
- Define the signal in each wires
	- Delays, frequencies, Amplitude, etc
	 WHICH CODE
- Define the spatial point to probe
- (Optional) Visualize the system. 
	 WHICH CODE
- Compute the field. 
- (Optional) Compute the rotating component with respect to a field. 
- (Optional) Mask the field near the wire. 

  --- Optional --- 
MORE INFO SOON
- Compare with an MRI or nifty 3D image ---
- Get the Affine transfo
- Get the map of the wires and mask the field around it. 


As an example, look and run the script "SCRIPT PLEASE!"


Next desired update:
-  The wire can have many frequencies (ie a general time-varying signal). 
- Calculate  the Electric field 
  (I will need to simplify the Jefimenko eqn in the electric field case.). 


Best,
Michael Caouette-Mansour
